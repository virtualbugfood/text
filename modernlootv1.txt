an old heavy duty Technocratic laptop. There's probably a 1 in 10 chance this thing even still has life in it, what could the password be?
a ceramic pig with chipped baby blue paint, the [2-4] coins on the inside have a layer of salt coating them. Spirits and supernatural creatures aligned with the sea seem to value these coins greatly.
a crate with [2-4] vintage glass bottles of Stay Awake. By now, these should be expired but they look fine. They give three extra actions to the drinker on their turn. Time seems to slow down for the drinker, yet from their perspective they're moving at their normal pace... This can't be healthy.
a largish tangle of twitching metal parts and wheels. It hums happy birthday once when touched then permanently powers down. It grants one wish, the wish must be thought in the head and thought as the machinery hums.
a strange syringe filled with glowing cyan fluid. It's labeled with a bright blue sticker with white text that says "CURE" on it. When injected, cure all health boxes, fatal wounds, scars, positive and negative physical mutations. Your skin is baby soft. If completely healthy when it's taken, your flesh begins to slough as you take 10 aggravated damage from becoming a mass of undifferentiated cells.
a strange little chemical vial of little mite sized nanites. When exposed to air they will invade the nearest living lifeform, who immediately takes 5 lethal damage as the brutishly efficient robots travel through the body. Decreases Strength by 3 dots and increases Intelligence by 2 dots (to a maximum of 8). If Strength is lowered past zero, the being perishes. If they manage to live, and are unawakened/unenlightened, they will awaken/enlighten with the nanites as their Avatar/Genius.
a can of UltraMeat™. One serving of UltraMeat™ is worth a week of rations, and will leave you satisfied and unhungry during that time period. It's not just meat, it's UltraMeat™!
a VHS copy of Disney's BAMBI copied over with a snuff film. Considering the grainy quality it's probably third-generation, filmed sometime in the early 1990s.
a chest rig of wiring, straps, and explosives, quite plainly a suicide vest. However, an explosives expert examining the vest will discover that the explosives are shaped charges, and the force of all is directed inwards rather than outwards. The remote detonator is next to it.
a glass vial with a plastic lid, containing a viscous green substance. An old label bears Russian Cyrillic letters. Below, a new label reads: "SIC SEMPER TYRANIS - WARNING ! Volatile//Neurotoxic".
